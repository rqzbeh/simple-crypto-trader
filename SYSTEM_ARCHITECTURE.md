**Learning System:**
```
Trade Logged → 4 Hours Pass → Outcome Verified → 
Feed to learn_from_trade() →
    ↓
Track Indicator Accuracy → Calculate Win Rate → Adjust Parameters
    ↓
Boost Good Indicators (1.5x weight) | Demote Bad Ones (0.3x weight)
    ↓
Adjust Confidence Threshold | Modify Risk Multiplier
```

**Adaptive Parameters:**
- **Confidence Threshold:** 0.2 (aggressive) → 0.6 (conservative)
  - Win rate > 65%: Lower threshold (more trades)
  - Win rate < 35%: Raise threshold (fewer, better trades)
- **Risk Multiplier:** 0.7 (cautious) → 1.1 (aggressive)
  - High volatility: Reduce risk
  - Low volatility + profitable: Increase risk
- **Indicator Weights:** 0.3x (poor) → 1.5x (excellent)
  - Accuracy > 65% + profitable: BOOST
  - Accuracy < 35%: DEMOTE

## 🔄 Complete System Flow

### **Main Trading Loop:**
```
1. Start main.py
   ↓
2. check_trade_outcomes() - Verify old trades, feed to learning
   ↓
3. Fetch news (last 8 hours)
   ↓
4. Extract crypto symbols from news
   ↓
5. For each symbol:
   a. Analyze sentiment with LLM (Groq)
   b. Get market data (4h candles, 30 days)
   c. Calculate technical indicators (get_all_indicators)
   d. Get dynamic indicator weights (market_analyzer.get_indicator_weight_multiplier)
   e. Combine analyses (market_analyzer.combine_analyses)
      - 70% News/AI score
      - 30% Technical filter
   f. Apply adaptive confidence threshold
   g. Generate trade signal if confident enough
   ↓
6. Sort signals by confidence
   ↓
7. Log top signals with indicator data (log_trade)
   ↓
8. Send Telegram notification
   ↓
9. Wait 4 hours → Next cycle repeats from step 2
```

## 🎯 News-Driven Strategy (70/30 Split)

### **PRIMARY SIGNAL SOURCE (70-80%):**
- News sentiment analysis
- LLM qualitative reasoning
- Market psychology
- Event-driven analysis

### **FILTER ONLY (20-30%):**
- Technical indicators validate/filter signals
- Strong technical contradiction = signal rejected
- Technical agreement = confidence boost

### **Why This Works:**
- Crypto is news-driven (regulations, partnerships, hacks)
- Technical analysis lags news events
- Technicals prevent bad entries (e.g., buying into resistance)
- Best of both worlds: news timing + technical validation

## 🧠 Adaptive Learning System

### **How It Works:**

#### 1. Trade Logging (main.py):
```python
log_trade(symbol, signal, sentiment_reason, indicators_signals)
# Stores: entry, SL, TP, indicators, check_time (4h later)
```

#### 2. Outcome Verification (main.py):
```python
check_trade_outcomes()
# Every cycle:
# - Find trades > 4 hours old
# - Fetch current price
# - Calculate actual profit/loss
# - Calculate TP distance vs actual price movement
# - Check if TP or SL hit
# - Feed to learning system with precision metrics
```

#### 3. Learning Update (llm_analyzer.py):
```python
market_analyzer.learn_from_trade(trade_result)
# - Track indicator accuracy
# - Track TP/SL precision (NEW)
# - Calculate win rate
# - Calculate direction accuracy separately from TP precision (NEW)
# - Adjust confidence threshold
# - Adjust TP targets based on precision (NEW)
# - Optimize indicator weights
# - Modify risk parameters
```

### **What Gets Tracked:**
- **Overall Performance:** Win rate, avg profit, trade count
- **Indicator Performance:** Accuracy, profit contribution per indicator
- **Direction Accuracy:** Was the predicted trend correct? (NEW)
- **TP Precision:** How close did price get to TP target? (NEW)
- **TP Overshoot:** How much TP is typically too ambitious? (NEW)
- **Avg Price Movement:** Actual price moves in 2-4h timeframe (NEW)
- **Confidence Threshold:** Dynamically adjusted based on win rate
- **Risk Multiplier:** Adjusted based on return volatility
- **TP Adjustment Factor:** Reduces/increases TP based on precision (NEW)

### **Precision Learning (NEW):**
The system now distinguishes between:
1. **Wrong Direction** - Predicted LONG but price went down
2. **Correct Direction, Too Ambitious TP** - Predicted LONG correctly, price went up but didn't reach TP
3. **Perfect Trade** - Predicted direction and TP were both correct

This allows the system to:
- Keep trading when direction is right but TP needs adjustment
- Reduce TP targets when they're consistently too far
- Increase TP targets when they're too conservative

### **Example Optimization:**
```
After 20 trades:
- Stoch RSI: 70% accuracy → Weight multiplier 1.5x (BOOST)
- MACD: 40% accuracy → Weight multiplier 0.7x (REDUCE)
- OBV: 30% accuracy → Weight multiplier 0.3x (DEMOTE)

Win rate = 40% → Confidence threshold increased to 0.45 (more selective)
High volatility → Risk multiplier reduced to 0.8 (smaller positions)

Direction accuracy = 65% (good trend prediction)
TP precision = 64% (TPs too ambitious - price moves only 64% of predicted distance)
→ TP adjustment factor = 0.70x (reduce future TPs by 30%)

Next trade:
- Raw TP calculation: 4.5%
- After adjustment: 4.5% × 0.70 = 3.15% (more realistic for 2-4h)
```

### **Benefits:**
- **More Realistic TPs:** Learns from actual market movements, not just theory
- **Better Win Rate:** TPs are achievable within 2-4h timeframe
- **Separate Metrics:** Knows if problem is direction or TP precision
- **Continuous Improvement:** Automatically adjusts to changing market conditions
